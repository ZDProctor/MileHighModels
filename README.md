#Instructions

## Attack 1
- Do the initial attack against the login.  What is a good attack?  Think about the underlying query and table structures.

We don't really know them, but we can imagine what they look like.

- How about a more general attack against the login?

## Students should now attack the dashboard

- Attack the dashboard.  How might you get at it?  Can you get elevated permissions?

- Can you attack financials?

- What other kinds of mayhem?

### What's the Super-Mean, Low-Down, No-Good query?

### What else?

## Final Student Attack (Hard)

Try to attack "My Orders" - Give me at least 2 attacks that work.  Use GPT if you need help.
